# A simple decision made to simulate German Unification question if it's not completed after 1900
# This decision will make Austria and Prussia partitioning Germany: North Germany goes to Prussia, South Germany goes to Austria
# The outcome of the decision and the chain of events will depend on the global role of Prussia and Austria.
# If only one is a great power, then the other will have much greater freedom.
