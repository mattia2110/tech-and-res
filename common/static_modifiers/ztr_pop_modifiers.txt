# A stage is reached when one of these conditions is met:
# Or Standard of living is 3 higher than expected previous stage.
# Or X years passed since last stage was reached. In order to simulate the transition.

# Actually, if every nation would be in stage 6, the richer nations would have an higher birth rate than poorer nations.
