je_france_pop: "19th Century Stagnation"
je_france_pop_reason: "[ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] was the first major European [Concept('concept_country','$concept_country$')] to experience advanced [Concept('concept_demographic_stages','$concept_demographic_stages$')]: already by the end of the first half 19th century, a decline in birth rates among [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] population was observed due to urbanization, cultural changes, availability of rudimentary contraception, greater female education, and inheritance policies."
je_france_pop_goal: "Increase Healthcare around [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] with laws, urban centers or researching new techs such as penicillin and antibiotics"

je_irish_independence: "Irish Question"
je_irish_independence_reason: "Ireland becomes part of the United Kingdom in 1801, but the Irish people have long sought independence. The Irish Question refers to the debate over whether Ireland should be an independent nation or remain part of the UK, despite the lack of a real economic or political integration. The Irish nationalist movement has gained momentum in recent years, with many advocating for self-determination and the establishment of an independent Irish state."
je_irish_independence_goal: "Reduce irish turmoil, maintain a low progress bar and, most important, enact cultural exclusion or multiculturalism laws."

je_arabia_unification: "Arabian Unification"
je_arabia_unification_reason: "The Arabian Peninsula is a region of great cultural and religious significance, but it has been divided into various states and tribal territories since the Abbasid Caliphate's decline. Today, with the rise of nationalism and the desire for unity, there is a growing movement to unify the Arabian Peninsula into a single nation. This unification would not only strengthen the region's political and economic power but also promote cultural and religious solidarity among its people."
je_arabia_unification_goal: "Unify the Arabian Peninsula, controlling Nejd, Hedjaz and Hail regions, diplomatically or militarily."

je_austrian_empire_collapse: "Austrian Empire Decline"
je_austrian_empire_collapse_reason: "The [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] Empire, once a dominant power in Europe, is now facing significant challenges. The rise of nationalism, economic difficulties, and the decline of imperial authority have led to widespread unrest and calls for independence among various nationalities within the empire. The empire's inability to adapt to the changing political landscape and its failure to address the aspirations of its diverse populations have contributed to its decline. The question now is whether the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] Empire can reform and survive or if it will succumb to the pressures of disintegration."
je_austrian_empire_collapse_goal: "Enact laws that promote cultural inclusion and rights, increase gdp per capita and keep a dominant position in the geopolitics of Europe as a great power. If you complete di JE, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] will collapse and be divided among its neighbors and inner nationalities. Last remind, Monarchy "

je_ottoman_empire_collapse_reason: "The [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName], the last middle east empire, is facing a long period of decline and instability, incapable to adapt to the changing political landscape of the 19th century. The rise of balkan nationalism, economic difficulties, Russian expansionism and European needs of oil are some of the problems that the empire must be prepared to face. The question now is whether the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] can reform and survive or if it will succumb to the pressures of disintegration."
je_ottoman_empire_collapse_goal: "Enact laws that promote cultural inclusion and rights, increase gdp per capita and keep a dominant position in the geopolitics of Europe as a great power.
