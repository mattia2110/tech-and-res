elgar_classicism_tech: "Classicism"
elgar_classicism_tech_desc: "Classicism, in the arts, refers generally to a high regard for a classical period, classical antiquity in the Western tradition, as setting standards for taste which the classicists seek to emulate. In its purest form, classicism is an aesthetic attitude dependent on principles based in the culture, art and literature of ancient Greece and Rome, with the emphasis on form, simplicity, proportion, clarity of structure, perfection, restrained emotion, as well as explicit appeal to the intellect."
elgar_irrationalism_tech: "Irrationalism"
elgar_irrationalism_tech_desc: "Irrationalism is a philosophical movement that emphasizes the role of the irrational, the unconscious, and the emotional in human experience. It challenges the dominance of reason and rationality in understanding reality, advocating for a more holistic approach that includes intuition, instinct, and subjective experience."
elgar_modern_art_tech: "Modern Art"
elgar_modern_art_tech_desc: "Modern art is a broad term that encompasses various artistic movements and styles that emerged from the late 19th century to the mid-20th century. It is characterized by a departure from traditional forms and conventions, embracing experimentation, abstraction, and new materials. Modern artists sought to challenge established norms and explore new ways of seeing and representing the world."
elgar_mass_culture_tech: "Mass Culture"
elgar_mass_culture_tech_desc: "The mass' uncomprehending hostility to all the traditions representative of the Culture, the keen and cold intelligence that confounds the wisdom of the peasant, the new found naturalism that in relation to all matters of sex and society goes back far to quite primitive instincts and conditions, the reappearance of the panem et circenses in the form of wage disputes and sports stadia - all these things betoken the definite closing down of the Culture and the opening of quite a new phase of human existence.' - Oswald Spengler, Decline of the West"
panum_antitoxins_tech: "Antitoxins"
panum_antitoxins_tech_desc: "Antitoxins are antibodies that neutralize toxins produced by pathogens, playing a crucial role in the immune response and the development of vaccines."
curtiss_modern_aviation_tech: "Modern Aviation"
curtiss_modern_aviation_tech_desc: "Civil aviation is one of two major categories of flying, representing all non-military and non-state aviation, both private and commercial. During the Golden Age of Aviation it became widespread. Long-distance flights for the luxury traveller became possible for the first time; the early services used airships, but, after the Hindenburg disaster, airships fell out of use and the flying boat came to dominate."
verrier_physics_tech: "Classical Physics"
verrier_physics_tech_desc: "Physics became a separate science when early modern Europeans used experimental and quantitative methods to discover what are now considered to be the laws of physics. Major developments in this period include the replacement of the geocentric model of the Solar System with the heliocentric Copernican model, the laws governing the motion of planetary bodies (determined by Kepler between 1609 and 1619), Galileo's pioneering work on telescopes and observational astronomy in the 16th and 17th Centuries, and Isaac Newton's discovery and unification of the laws of motion and universal gravitation (that would come to bear his name)."
verrier_astronomy_tech: "Modern Astronomy"
verrier_astronomy_tech_desc: "During the 18-19th centuries, the study of the three-body problem by Leonhard Euler, Alexis Claude Clairaut, and Jean le Rond d'Alembert led to more accurate predictions about the motions of the Moon and planets. This work was further refined by Joseph-Louis Lagrange and Pierre Simon Laplace, allowing the masses of the planets and moons to be estimated from their perturbations."
verrier_electromagnetism_tech: "Electromagnetism"
verrier_electromagnetism_tech_desc: "In 1864 James Clerk Maxwell of Edinburgh announced his electromagnetic theory of light, which was perhaps the greatest single step in the world's knowledge of electricity. Maxwell's electromagnetic theory of light obviously involved the existence of electric waves in free space, and his followers set themselves the task of experimentally demonstrating the truth of the theory. The discovery of electromagnetic waves in space led to the development of radio in the closing years of the 19th century."
verrier_chemistry_tech: "Chemistry"
verrier_chemistry_tech_desc: "The development of the electrochemical theory of chemical combinations occurred in the early 19th century as the result of the work of two scientists in particular, Jöns Jacob Berzelius and Humphry Davy, made possible by the prior invention of the voltaic pile by Alessandro Volta. ritish William Prout first proposed ordering all the elements by their atomic weight as all atoms had a weight that was an exact multiple of the atomic weight of hydrogen. J.A.R. Newlands devised an early table of elements, which was then developed into the modern periodic table of elements."
verrier_astro_physics_tech: "Astrophysics" #Please replace
verrier_astro_physics_tech_desc: "Astrophysics is a science that employs the methods and principles of physics and chemistry in the study of astronomical objects and phenomena. As one of the founders of the discipline, James Keeler, said, Astrophysics 'seeks to ascertain the nature of the heavenly bodies, rather than their positions or motions in space - what they are, rather than where they are'." #Please replace
verrier_modern_physics_tech: "Modern Physics"
verrier_modern_physics_tech_desc: "Modern physics is a branch of physics that developed in the early 20th century. Notable branches of modern physics include quantum mechanics, special relativity and general relativity. It is concerned with extreme conditions, such as high velocities that are comparable to the speed of light, small distances comparable to the atomic radius, and very high energies."
verrier_nuclear_physics_tech: "Nuclear Physics"
verrier_nuclear_physics_tech_desc: "Nuclear physics is the branch of physics that deals with the structure and behavior of atomic nuclei. Nuclear physics deals with the elucidation of the nuclear structure, i.e. the details of the structure of the atomic nuclei and their reactions. For this purpose, for example, spontaneous transformations of nuclei (radioactivity), scattering processes on nuclei and reactions with nuclei are investigated experimentally and theoretically. Technologies based on nuclear fission and nuclear fusion are based on nuclear physics research."
manzoni_rotary_press_tech: "Rotary Press"
manzoni_rotary_press_tech_desc: "By rotating a cylindrically distorted type plate and feeding paper through it, printing is possible at much higher speeds than previously possible."
manzoni_linotype_tech: "Linotype"
manzoni_linotype_tech_desc: "Instead of selecting and placing type one letter at a time, type is placed by tapping on a keyboard at hand, reducing dependence on skilled workers and speeding up typesetting operations."
agassiz_geology_tech: "Geology"
agassiz_geology_tech_desc: "In 1815, canal builder William Smith published his map of the geology of England and Wales, which took into account both fossil content and lithology. Smith recognized that certain rock sequences are also characterized by a very specific, unmistakable faunal sequence. In 1827, Leopold von Buch coined the term index fossil for fossils that allow relative dating. From now on, clarifying the question of the actual age of the Earth was a scientific matter."
dubois_theory_of_evolution_tech: "Theory of Evolution"
dubois_theory_of_evolution_tech_desc: "The crucial break from the concept of constant typological types in biology came with the theory of evolution through natural selection. Darwin noted that population growth would lead to a 'struggle for existence' in which favourable variations prevailed as others perished. This could explain the diversity of plants and animals from a common ancestry. Some were disturbed by this since it implied that humans did not have a special place in the universe."
dubois_paleontology_tech: "Paleontology"
dubois_paleontology_tech_desc: "An interest in the history of the earth and extinct animals can be traced back to antiquity and reached a first peak with the studies of Georges Cuvier around 1800. But the publication of the 'On the Origin of Species' was a watershed event in all the life sciences, especially paleontology. The scientific debate that started immediately after the publication of 'Origin' led to a concerted effort to look for transitional fossils and other evidence of evolution in the fossil record."
dubois_genetics_tech: "Genetics"
dubois_genetics_tech_desc: "Modern genetics began with the work of the Augustinian friar Gregor Johann Mendel. The 1900 rediscovery of Mendel's work led to rapid advances in genetics. By 1915 the basic principles of Mendelian genetics had been studied in a wide variety of organisms — most notably the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. Alongside experimental work, mathematicians developed the statistical framework of population genetics, bringing genetic explanations into the study of evolution."
dubois_nature_protection_tech: "Nature Protection"
dubois_nature_protection_tech_desc: "Nature Protection started with the need to protect forests. Later, endangered animal species and entire areas of land were also protected. In the 19th and 20th centuries, there were various successful nature conservation projects, such as the reintroduction of the Alpine ibex in the Swiss Alps."
curtiss_montgolfier_balloon_tech: "Montgolfier Balloons"
curtiss_montgolfier_balloon_tech_desc: "Montgolfière is the name of the first hot air balloon, named after French inventors Joseph Michel and Jacques Etienne Montgolfier. Word of the 'aerostatic machines' quickly spread throughout Europe. The first military use of aircraft took place during the French Revolutionary Wars, when the French used a tethered hydrogen balloon to observe the movements of the Austrian army during the Battle of Fleurus (1794)."
curtiss_messenger_pidgeons_tech: "Messenger Pigeons"
curtiss_messenger_pidgeons_tech_desc: "The pigeon post was rare until the 1820s. In 1860, Paul Reuter used a fleet of over 45 pigeons to deliver news and stock prices between Brussels and Aachen, the terminus of early telegraph lines. During the Franco-Prussian War pigeons were used to carry mail between defeated Paris and the French unoccupied territory. In December 1870, it took ten hours for a pigeon carrying microfilms to fly from Perpignan to Brussels."
curtiss_reconnaissance_balloon_tech: "Reconnaissance Balloons"
curtiss_reconnaissance_balloon_tech_desc: "A reconnaissance balloon is a balloon filled with a gas mixture that is equipped with military reconnaissance technology. The balloon was used as an observation post during the American Civil War and the Franco-German War. The manned captive balloons were let into the air on a rope in order to observe the enemy lines and pass the situation on to the own teams below."
curtiss_early_aviation_tech: "Early Aviation"
curtiss_early_aviation_tech_desc: "Between 1867 and 1896, the German pioneer of human aviation Otto Lilienthal developed heavier-than-air flight. He was the first person to make well-documented, repeated, successful gliding flights. Lilienthal's work led to him developing the concept of the modern wing, which heavily inspired further development. The American Wright brothers flights in 1903 are recognized as 'the first sustained and controlled heavier-than-air powered flight'."
curtiss_seaplanes_tech: "Seaplanes"
curtiss_seaplanes_tech_desc: "On 28 March 1910, Frenchman Henri Fabre flew the first successful powered seaplane, the Gnome Omega-powered hydravion, a trimaran floatplane. Fabre's first successful take off and landing by a powered seaplane inspired other aviators. The first hydro-aeroplane competition was held in Monaco in March 1912, featuring aircraft using floats from Fabre, Curtiss, Tellier and Farman. The French Navy ordered its first floatplane in the same year."

The World Tourism Organization defines tourists as people who 'travel to and stay in places outside their usual environment for not more than one consecutive year for leisure, business and other purposes'."
agassiz_sounding_tech: "Echo Sounding"
agassiz_sounding_tech_desc: "The depth sounder was first invented as a response to submarine warfare. Later, however, it would also be used in many civilian areas: for example, in locating schools of fish and in deep-sea research."
theiler_microbiology_tech: "Microbiology"
theiler_microbiology_tech_desc: "Microbiological examinations had been carried out with the first microscopes since the 17th century, but it was only with the medical advances of the 19th century and the improvement of microscope technology that a new branch of biological-medical research emerged that fundamentally changed many areas of everyday life."
panum_vaccination_tech: "Vaccination"
panum_vaccination_tech_desc: "The smallpox vaccine is the first vaccine to have been developed against a contagious disease. In 1796, British physician Edward Jenner demonstrated that an infection with the relatively mild cowpox virus conferred immunity against the deadly smallpox virus."

mendelejew_synthetic_fuel_tech: "Synthetic Fuel"
mendelejew_synthetic_fuel_tech_desc: "The Bergius-Pier process is a large-scale process for coal liquefaction by direct hydrogenation of coal. The macromolecules of the coal are broken down into smaller molecules by hydrogen at high pressures and temperatures. Gaseous and liquid hydrocarbons are created as products and are used as fuels and lubricants. Between 1910 and 1925, the German chemist Friedrich Bergius developed the basics of the process. Commercial process and catalyst development was carried out by BASF from 1925 under the project management of Matthias Pier."
mendelejew_synthetic_rubber_tech: "Synthetic Rubber"
mendelejew_synthetic_rubber_tech_desc: "A synthetic rubber is an artificial elastomer. They are polymers synthesized from petroleum byproducts. Synthetic rubbers are superior to natural rubbers in two major respects: thermal stability, and resistance to oils and related compounds."
vikelas_international_sports_tech: "International Sports"
vikelas_international_sports_tech_desc: "The popularity of sporting competitions spread first nationally, then internationally. To better regulate competitions between nations, international committees, federations, and rules were needed. The Olympic Games and the IOC are the most prominent figures in this development."
