ztr_russian_revolution_minorities_unrest.t: "Unrest Among the Minorities"
ztr_russian_revolution_minorities_unrest.d: "Our vast empire encompasses many peoples, not all of whom share our culture or language. From the Baltic to the Caucasus, whispers of discontent are growing. Without a policy of inclusion, these diverse groups feel alienated and oppressed, fueling instability across our non-Russian lands."
ztr_russian_revolution_minorities_unrest.option: "This is a worrying development."
ztr_russian_revolution_minorities_unrest.f: "From the Baltic provinces to the Caucasus mountains, the reports from our regional governors grow more alarming. Local assemblies speak of cultural preservation, but their words carry the sharp edge of separatism. This is not isolated dissent; it is a systemic failure to integrate the diverse peoples of our Empire. They feel unheard and unrepresented, a dangerous sentiment that agitators are only too eager to exploit."

ztr_russian_revolution_peasant_unrest.t: "Peasant Unrest"
ztr_russian_revolution_peasant_unrest.d: "The bedrock of our society, the peasantry, is cracking. Bound by the chains of [Concept('concept_serfdom','$concept_serfdom')], their lives are ones of toil and hardship. The [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('russia_peasants_scope').GetName] are growing increasingly restless, demanding freedom and land. Their simmering anger threatens the very stability of the countryside."
ztr_russian_revolution_peasant_unrest.option: "We must address their concerns."
ztr_russian_revolution_peasant_unrest.f: "Your Excellency, the provincial marshals of nobility report that the peasantry is in a state of near-open revolt. They are refusing their obligations, and there are credible reports of organized land seizures and attacks on manors. The [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('russia_peasants_scope').GetName] are fueling this fire, preaching that the land belongs to those who work it. The traditional order in the countryside is collapsing."

ztr_russian_revolution_serfdom_outlawed.t: "Serfdom Abolished"
ztr_russian_revolution_serfdom_outlawed.d: "As the ancient institution of [Concept('concept_serfdom','$concept_serfdom')] has finally been abolished. Millions of our peasants are now free, unshackled from the land they were bound to. This great reform, championed by the [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('russia_peasants_scope').GetName], promises to reshape our society and economy. This will surely help to maintain order in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]."
ztr_russian_revolution_serfdom_outlawed.option: "A new era of freedom!"
ztr_russian_revolution_serfdom_outlawed.f: "By Imperial Manifesto, the ancient and burdensome institution of serfdom is hereby abolished. This is a momentous step, a necessary measure to modernize our great nation and alleviate the suffering of the common folk. The [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('russia_peasants_scope').GetName] have hailed this as a victory for justice. Let it be known that a new chapter of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] history begins today, one of freedom and progress under the Tsar's benevolent guidance."

ztr_russian_revolution_liberals_not_with_us.t: "The Liberal Opposition"
ztr_russian_revolution_liberals_not_with_us.d: "The [Concept('concept_autocracy','Autocratic')] rule of the #v Tsars#! in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] has long been a defining feature of its political landscape. However, the pressures of modernization, social unrest, and the influence of new ideologies are challenging the foundations of this absolutist system. As calls for reform grow louder and more organized, the question arises: can the Tsarist regime adapt to the changing times, or is it destined to fall to the forces of change sweeping through the empire?\nIn this context, the [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('russia_liberals_scope').GetName] are proving to be a difficult bloc. While they desire modernization, their vision for [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] clashes with our own, since they advocate for liberties that we are not prepared to grant."
ztr_russian_revolution_liberals_not_with_us.option: "Their vision is not our own, but we can work around them."
ztr_russian_revolution_liberals_not_with_us.f: "The [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('russia_liberals_scope').GetName] are a frustrating paradox. They speak the language of progress, advocating for factories, railways, and modern laws. Yet, in the same breath, they demand parliaments and freedoms that would fatally undermine the very authority needed to implement such reforms. They see our autocracy as the obstacle, failing to understand it is the only bulwark against chaos."

ztr_russian_revolution_strange_proletariat.d:"A new class is emerging in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]: the #vindustrial proletariat#!. Though small and born from peasant roots, it shows a fervor and class-consciousness unlike that of #v Western Europe#!. While #v Marx#! imagined a communist revolution arising from a mature and numerous working class, our own is still young but already restless and aware. The [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('russia_bolsheviks_scope').GetName] rally them, and radical ideas spread like wildfire. This awakening, in a land of peasants, could reshape the empire itself."
ztr_russian_revolution_strange_proletariat.option:"A strange, fiery force is rising in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]."
ztr_russian_revolution_strange_proletariat.f: "Minister, the reports from our industrial centers are disquieting. The new factory workers, drawn straight from the villages, are not behaving as expected. They are organizing with alarming speed. Unlike the proletariat of the West, ours is small but uniquely volatile, detached from their rural traditions and highly receptive to the most extreme ideologies. The [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('russia_bolsheviks_scope').GetName] are channeling this energy, turning industrial grievances into a direct political threat against the state."

ztr_russian_revolution_intelligentsia_ambiguity.t: "The Intelligentsia's Demands"
ztr_russian_revolution_intelligentsia_ambiguity.d: "The [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('russia_intelligentsia_scope').GetName] have approached us with a set of demands. They do not care to point out that the majority of their interest group has a better opinion of the #negative_value Communists#! than of the monarchical authority, as they seek greater funding for [concept('concept_literacy','Education')], investments in [concept('concept_innovation','Research')], and a general loosening of censorship and traditionalism chains to allow the free exchange of ideas."
ztr_russian_revolution_intelligentsia_ambiguity.option: "Their requests are huge, but reasonable for [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] situation. Fund their efforts."
ztr_russian_revolution_intelligentsia_ambiguity_refuse.option: "We cannot afford these luxuries, nor the having good relationship with that #negative_value Communists#!."
ztr_russian_revolution_intelligentsia_ambiguity.f: "The petition from the [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('russia_intelligentsia_scope').GetName] lays out a clear bargain. They ask for state funds to build schools and laboratories, and for the censor's pen to be lightened. They claim this is the only path to a modern, powerful [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]. Yet, we must ask ourselves: will these new universities produce loyal engineers and scientists, or will they become breeding grounds for the very radicals who seek to tear our empire apart? They offer a key to the future, but it may also unlock Pandora's Box."

ztr_russian_revolution_treaty_liberals.t: "A Pact with the Liberals"
ztr_russian_revolution_treaty_liberals.d: "The [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('russia_liberals_scope').GetName] have offered a path to cooperation. They are willing to support the government and moderate their political ambitions in exchange for significant economic concessions and a clear commitment to national modernization. This 'treaty' could secure stability and progress, but it binds us to their economic agenda."
ztr_russian_revolution_treaty_liberals_accept.option: "Accept the treaty. Modernization is paramount."
ztr_russian_revolution_treaty_liberals_refuse.option: "We will not be held hostage by their demands."

ztr_russian_revolution_treaty_liberals.f: "The [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('russia_liberals_scope').GetName] have extended an olive branch, though one heavy with conditions. They propose a 'Treaty of Modernization.' In essence, they will guarantee their political support and use their influence to stabilize the economy, *if* we commit fully to their economic program. This means prioritizing industrial development and market reforms above all else. It is an alliance of convenience, binding our fortunes to theirs."

ztr_russian_revolution_petition.t: "The Industrialists' Petition"
ztr_russian_revolution_petition.d: "The [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('government_petition_ig').GetName] have formally petitioned the government. Citing the need for economic progress, they are demanding we enact [SCOPE.sLaw('government_petition_law').GetName]. They have also suggested [SCOPE.sLaw('government_petition_law_2').GetName] as an alternative, but their message is clear: the current laws are hindering the nation's industrial potential."
ztr_russian_revolution_petition.f: "To the Esteemed Council of Ministers, We, the representatives of the [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('government_petition_ig').GetName], formally submit this petition on behalf of the nation's economic future. The current legal framework, while perhaps suitable for a bygone era, now actively stifles the industrial potential of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]. We therefore implore the government to enact [SCOPE.sLaw('government_petition_law').GetName] without delay. Should this primary measure be unfeasible, [SCOPE.sLaw('government_petition_law_2').GetName] would serve as a partial, though less desirable, remedy."

ztr_russian_revolution_duma_role.t: "The Duma's Role"
ztr_russian_revolution_duma_role.d: "As the treaty negotiations progress, the role of the #v Duma#! becomes increasingly important. It is seen as a potential mediator between the government and the various interest groups vying for power. The Pure Liberals see it as a platform to push their agenda, while the Industrialists view it as a means to legitimize their economic reforms. The Duma's influence could shape the future of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective]'s political landscape, and saving the Empire from further unrest."
ztr_russian_revolution_duma_role.option: "The Duma must play a central role in our governance."

ztr_duma_low_strata_question.d: "The #v Duma#! is debating the 'Low Strata Question,' a contentious issue regarding the standard of living of the lower classes in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]. Helping the poor could alleviate social tensions and reduce [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('russia_bolsheviks_scope').GetName] influence, but we are surprised to see some divisions among the #v Liberals#! themselves, and that only a small minority of [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('russia_liberals_scope').GetName] wants to help the lower classes."
ztr_duma_low_strata_question_refuse.option: "They are right, modernization of the means of production is more important."

ztr_russian_revolution_liberals_stop_supporting_us.d: "After the last disputies, the [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('russia_liberals_scope').GetName] have decided to withdraw their support for the government. They are disappointed by our refusal to support their agenda and see us as an obstacle to [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective]'s modernization.
